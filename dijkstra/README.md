Dijkstra's Algorithm
--------------------

A graph search algorithm, written in C.

#### Synopsis ####

Dijkstra's algorithm, written in 1956 by Edsger Dijkstra, solves the single-source shortest path path problem for a graph with non-negative edge costs. This implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm utilizes a Fibonacci heap to produce the fastest known single-source shortest-path algorithm, running in O(|E| + |V|log|V|).
